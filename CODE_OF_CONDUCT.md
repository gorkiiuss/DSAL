## Purpose

The DSAL (Data Structures and Algorithms Library) community is committed to providing an open and welcoming environment
for all contributors, regardless of background or identity. We value the participation of every member and strive to
maintain a respectful and inclusive atmosphere for collaboration. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all
those who participate in our project, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We expect all members of our community to follow this Code of Conduct in all project-related spaces, including but not
limited to project repositories, issue trackers, forums, and discussions.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Respect**: Treat all community members with respect and kindness, regardless of their identity, background, or
  opinions.
- **Inclusivity**: Embrace diversity and ensure that everyone feels welcome to participate, regardless of their level of
  experience.
- **Open Collaboration**: Encourage and support others in their contributions, and be open to feedback and constructive
  criticism.
- **Professionalism**: Maintain a professional and courteous tone in all interactions, avoiding offensive language and
  personal attacks.

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- **Harassment**: Any form of harassment, discrimination, or offensive behavior will not be tolerated. This includes but
  is not limited to verbal, physical, or visual harassment.
- **Intimidation**: Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or threats are unacceptable, whether online or in person.
- **Invasion of Privacy**: Do not publish private or personal information about others without their explicit consent.
- **Unwelcome Advances**: Unwanted advances, both online and offline, are not appropriate within our community.

## Responsibilities

Community maintainers and administrators are responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. They have the right and
responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that violate this
Code of Conduct. By participating in DSAL, you agree to follow these standards and acknowledge that enforcement
decisions are final.

## Reporting Violations

If you witness or experience behavior that violates the Code of Conduct, please report it by contacting the project
maintainers at [gorkapuentediez@gmail.com](mailto:gorkapuentediez@gmail.com). All reports will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and confidentially.

## Consequences

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated within the DSAL community. Anyone who violates this Code of Conduct may be
subject to consequences, including but not limited to:

- Warning: A private, written warning from community maintainers, providing clarity on the violation and consequences.
- Temporary Suspension: Temporary exclusion from any community activity, including online and offline events.
- Permanent Ban: Permanent expulsion from the DSAL community, including removal from project repositories and
  communication channels.

We expect all community members to comply with these rules and take appropriate corrective action when requested by
community maintainers. Failure to do so may result in consequences determined by the maintainers.
